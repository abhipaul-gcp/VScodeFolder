PDF Size Reducer (using pypdf)This is a Python command-line script that utilizes the pypdf library to reduce the file size of PDF documents. It achieves reduction through lossless compression of content streams and removal of duplicate objects within the PDF structure.⚙️ PrerequisitesYou must have Python installed. The script relies on the pypdf library, which can be installed using pip:pip install pypdf
🚀 UsageThe script is executed via the command line and requires the input and output file paths. The compression level is an optional argument.Basic Syntaxpython pdf_compressor.py <INPUT_FILE_PATH> <OUTPUT_FILE_PATH> [OPTIONS]
Examples1. Max Compression (Default)If you omit the -c or --compression flag, the script defaults to the maximum lossless compression level (9).python pdf_compressor.py original.pdf compressed.pdf
2. Specific Compression LevelTo specify a custom compression level (from 0 to 9, where 9 is max compression):python pdf_compressor.py original.pdf compressed_level5.pdf -c 5
🔬 ArgumentsArgumentRequiredTypeDescriptionINPUT_FILE_PATHYesstringPath to the PDF file you wish to compress.OUTPUT_FILE_PATHYesstringPath where the new, compressed PDF will be saved.-c, --compressionNointegerOptional. The level of zlib compression to apply to content streams. Must be between 0 (no compression) and 9 (maximum compression). Defaults to 9.💡 How it WorksThe file size reduction is achieved through the following steps using the pypdf library:Content Stream Compression: For every page in the source PDF, the script applies a Zlib/Deflate filter to the page's content streams using page.compress_content_streams(). This is a lossless compression technique, meaning text and vector graphics quality are preserved while reducing the file size by optimizing how the data is stored.Duplicate Object Removal: The script uses writer.compress_identical_objects() to identify and remove redundant, duplicated objects (like the same image or font) that may have been embedded multiple times in the original PDF, further reducing the file size.
